# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

## Project Description

"Around the U.S." is a web project showcasing beautiful locations across the United States. Users can view a collection of cards, each representing a different scenic spot. The project highlights key information about each location with a picture and description. The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Functionality

- Display a grid of location cards, each with an image and title.
- Profile section with an avatar, name, description, and action buttons.
- Footer with copyright information.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **HTML5**: Used semantic tags to ensure the document structure is clear and accessible.
- **CSS3**: Employed modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid for responsive design. Media queries are used to adapt the layout to various screen sizes.
- **BEM Methodology**: Implemented Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming convention for better organization and maintainability of the CSS code.
- **Fonts and Icon Integration**: Connected custom fonts using @font-face and imported fonts from Google Fonts to enhance the typography.
- **Normalize.css**: Included to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and project hosting, with commits and branches to manage the development process.

## Responsive Design

The project is designed to be fully responsive:

- **Desktop**: Full layout with large images and text.
- **Tablet**: Adjusted layout for medium-sized screens.
- **Mobile**: Compact layout with smaller font sizes and images, ensuring readability and usability on small screens.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
